# How to contribute

If you find Clio interesting and you want to help develop the Clio programming language, you are at the right place.
We want to build a community around Clio and we're glad you're reading this.

## Reporting bugs

If you found a bug, feel free to open a new issue on our github if it isn't already reported. If reported,
you can join the discussion.

## Pull requests

If you fixed a bug or wrote a new set of tests for Clio, simply send a pull request and explain what is changed
and why it is changed. For now we don't have any special requirements for the pull requests.

## How to add/change a feature, API or a part of the syntax

We are planning to have Python style enhancement propositions.
We named them CED (Clio Enhancement Dossiers) because they're more than just a proposition.
These dossiers contain propositions, reasonings, examples, discussions and everything about a
new or existing feature.

For now, we are not able to add new features to the language as we are polishing the existing and current
set of features as well as the language syntax. However, if you have a suggestion, feel free to file an issue
on our github.

## What we need help with

Currently we need help with:

- **Documentation**: We need a better documentation, more examples and tutorials
- **Tests**: We need to reach an acceptable test coverage
- **Bugs**: We need people to write Clio code, test features, give feedback and report bugs
- **Tools**: We have a basic set of tools and an online editor, but they're far from perfect

## Coding style

To keep the looks of our source code unified, we have a few requirements regarding your code contributions:

- Commits must conform to the [prettier.io](https://prettier.io/) linting styles. Before committing, format your code using the prettier plugin for your editor, or run `npm run lint:fix` to make sure your code complies to our style guidelines.
- Use `camelCase` for functions, variables and methods, `PascalCase` for classes, and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for globals.

You can get more ideas by reading our code.

Thanks for your ideas and contributions to Clio,
Pouya
