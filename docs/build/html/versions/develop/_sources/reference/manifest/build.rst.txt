Build section
=============

The ``[build]`` section of the project manifest provides options
regarding the build process of the project.

.. code:: toml

   [build]
   source = "src"
   destination = "build"
   target = "js"

The ``destination`` field
-------------------------

This field specifies the relative path of the output directory of your
builds. By default, directory ``build`` will be used.

The ``source`` field
--------------------

This field specifies the relative path of the input directory of your
builds. By default, directory ``src`` will be used.

The ``target`` field
--------------------

The ``target`` field defines which code generator will be used to build
the source code. Currently only “js” target is supported, “llvm” or
“wasm” targets are planned for future releases.
