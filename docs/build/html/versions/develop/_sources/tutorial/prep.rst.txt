Prepreparation
==============

Youâ€™re going to need a clean environment to run the code samples in this
guide. Navigate to a directory (eg. ``~/projects`` or ``C://projects``)
and run the following command to make a new Clio project:

.. code:: bash

   clio new learn-clio

Then ``cd`` into the new directory (``learn-clio``, if you ran the above
command as is, otherwise the name you chose for your project), and
continue with this guide.

Please note you can also use the Clio `playground`_ to test out the code
samples.

.. _playground: https://playground.clio-lang.org/
