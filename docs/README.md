# Clio Documentation

Clio is a pure functional lazy-evaluated programming language targeting decentralized and distributed systems. It is made to take advantage of multiple CPUs and CPU cores \(parallelism\) by default, to run on clusters and on the cloud easily.

Clio compiles to JavaScript. This makes Clio fast, easy to port and easy to extend. It gives Clio a free JIT compiler, a powerful VM and access to lots of existing libraries. It enables Clio to run in the browser and on servers, and anywhere JavaScript can run.
