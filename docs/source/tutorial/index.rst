Official Tutorial
=================

This is the official guide and tutorial for Clio. Please note this is a
work in progress, Clio isn’t ready for production, it’s not stable yet,
there isn’t a decent standard library or a set of built-ins. At this
state, Clio is only suitable for language enthusiasts, experts who want
to explore new possibilities, contributors and early adopters. You can
also find links to blog posts, examples and third-party websites at the
end of this page.
