Slicing
=======

Slicing has the same syntax as JavaScript:

.. playground::
  :height: 320

  export fn main:
    arr = [1 2 3 4]
    console.log arr[3]

.. attention::
  Older versions of Clio supported multi-dimensional and matrix slicing in the core language,
  the same is planned for the future versions of Clio.
