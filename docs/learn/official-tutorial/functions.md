# Functions

Functions, are everything in Clio. In fact in your program's body you can only use functions \(and function imports\). here's how we define them:

```text
fn add a b:
  a + b
```

In above code we define a function named `add`, this function accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`, what it does is adding `a` and `b` together. We don't have a `return` keyword in Clio, all functions return the last evaluated expression.
