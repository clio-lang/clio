# Prepreparation

You're going to need a clean environment to run the code samples in this guide. Navigate to a directory \(eg. `~/projects` or `C://projects`\) and run the following command to make a new Clio project:

```bash
clio new tutorial
```

Then `cd` into the new directory \(`tutorial`, if you ran the above command as is, otherwise the name you chose for your project\), and continue with this guide.

Please note you can also use the [Clio playground](https://playground.clio-lang.org/) to test out the code samples.
