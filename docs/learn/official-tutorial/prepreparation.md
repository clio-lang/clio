# Prepreparation

You're going to need a clean environment to run the code samples in this guide. Navigate to a directory \(eg. `~/projects` or `C://projects`\) and run the following command to make a new Clio project:

```bash
clio new tutorial
```

Then `cd` into the new directory \(`tutorial`, if you ran the above command as is, otherwise the name you chose for your project\), and continue with this guide.

Please note you can also use the Clio playground to test out the code samples.
