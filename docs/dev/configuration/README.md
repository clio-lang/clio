# Configuration

## The `CLIOENV` variable

If the `CLIOENV` variable is set, Clio will skip the installation of the `clio-internals` package during the build process, and instead copy the local source code to the location of the `clio-internals` package (Refer to [#146](https://github.com/clio-lang/clio/pull/146)).
