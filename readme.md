# Clio

Clio is a functional, distributed programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It runs in the browser and on the server and is made to be a suitable language for scientific programming. Clio takes advantage of multiple CPUs and multiple CPU cores (parallelism) by default, is able to use network resources, is easy to run on clusters and on the cloud.

Read [Clio documentation](https://docs.clio-lang.org) or visit our [website](https://clio-lang.org) for more info.
