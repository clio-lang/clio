# Support Clio

I want to thank all the backers and supporters of the project,
all those who have contributed to the project at any point in time,
supported us financially, gave us a star on github, wrote about
us, provided us with feebacks, kept us motivated and were active
in our community in any other ways.

I appreciate all the help, and all your contributions, without which
the project wouldn't be what it is today. Thank you all for helping
us grow, share our vision and letting this happen!

## Funds
